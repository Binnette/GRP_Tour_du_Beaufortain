# Day 3: from Croix de Pierre to Plan Jovet

We woke up to a magnificent sight of the mountains, shimmering like waves of sand in the morning light.

Then we enjoyed the fresh and pure water that we found along the way. We stopped at some small streams to wash and cool ourselves.

We then reached the ski resort of Les Contamines and climbed up to the Col du Joly, where we had a panoramic view of the mountains and Mont Blanc.

From there, we decided to take a different route from the official GR and headed towards the Col de la Fen√™tre.

After the Col de la Fen√™tre, we passed by an old mine and filled up our bottles with cold water that came out of a large concrete pipe. Position of the pipe:

It was a nice surprise to find such a refreshing source. We continued our hike until we arrived at Plan du Jovet, where we enjoyed a cold but very welcome bath in the stream. We also washed some of our clothes with nothing but the pure water. It felt good to be clean and relaxed after a long day of hiking. Finaly we set up our tents for the night.
