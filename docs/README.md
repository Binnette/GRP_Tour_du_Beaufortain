Our trek lasted for seven days and 6 nights, we camped at different spots along the way. You can see our route and our bivouac locations ‚õ∫Ô∏è on the map above. We started and ended our trek in Queige üè≥Ô∏è, where we left our car. We followed the trail clockwise, exploring the natural beauty and diversity of the Beaufortain.

Comparison of elevation gain, D+ üü• and D- üü© per day:

![Elevation per day](img/elevation_bar_chart.svg)

If you are planning to start your trek from Queige, I suggest that you go clockwise. This way, you will have a more gradual ascent on the first day, reaching the Refuge du Lachat with an elevation gain of about 1300 meters. This is a good option considering that you are carrying a heavy backpack with food and other supplies. If you go counter-clockwise, you will face a steeper climb of about 1700 meters on the first day, which can be very challenging and exhausting.
