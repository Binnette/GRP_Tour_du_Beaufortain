# Day 6: from Lac de Saint-Gu√©rin to Lacs de Lavouet

We packed our tents and soon crossed a beautiful Himalayan bridge over one arm of Lac de Saint-Gu√©rin.

We began a long climb and stopped at Refuge de l‚ÄôAlpage to refill our water bottles. Outside the refuge, a sign invited hikers to refill water in the toilets, but another sign indicated that toilets were reserved for customers. We ignored the second sign and refilled anyway.

We kept climbing the mountain and enjoyed the view and some flowers: Epilobes en √©pi on this picture.

After the hiking sign "Pied de T√™te Rouge", I decided to run to the next refuge. I dropped most of my water to make my backpack very light. I passed some other hikers and took a short break at Lac Tournant.

More running in the mountain and I finally reached Refuge les Arolles. It was closed and many elderly hikers were disappointed not to be able to buy some drinks there. I waited there for my friend for a long time.

After having lunch break near the refuge, we resumed our hike and passed by a white cross at Col de la Bathie.

Continuing our journey, we refilled our bottles with the fresh water coming from the waterfall behind Lac du Soufflet.

We kept hiking and found a really nice bathing spot in the stream going down from the Lacs de Lavouet. After a cold but very refreshing bath in the river, we pitched our tents and some curious cows came to drool on my friend‚Äôs tent. But we were lucky that they left soon after, otherwise we would have to sleep with a bell concert in our ears.

Our night spot with the cute bathing place nearby:
