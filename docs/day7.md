# Day 7: from Lacs de Lavouet back to Queige

The last day of our hike! After breakfast, we quickly reached Col des Lacs and had a view of the city of Albertville:

We started our descent and saw some tiny swamps on our way.

After reaching the pass near the peak La Roche Pourrie, we began a very long and tiring descent to Queige. It was all downhill from there. I took a small break and visited the tiny alpine hut Les Mozes.

And again we continued going down and crossed some Coulemelles / L√©piotes √©lev√©es on the way:

As we went down, at some point the trail was in a very bad shape. We had to walk in the track of a forest tractor full of mud. But after a lot of effort, we finally saw our final destination, the city of Queige!

To conclude this adventure, this GRP was amazing. I really liked that this trail was not crowded. At all the refuges that we stopped by, the keepers were nice and friendly. The mountains in Beaufortain were very stunning and full of cows for the production of the famous Beaufort cheese, which we bought some to take back home. This trek also featured great views of Mont Blanc. We really enjoyed that bivouac was allowed anywhere, except around the lakes, but it did not bother us as we always found suitable spots to pitch our tents. Also, we were happy to find drinking water during every stage of our trek. Feel free to consult the [map]() I made with a lot of info on our trek and even places where you should find water.

A final word about this GRP Tour du Beaufortain, we highly recommend it!
