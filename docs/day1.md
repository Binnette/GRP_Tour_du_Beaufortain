# Day 1 : from Queiche to Refuge du Lachat

We drive and left our car in a parking spot near the church in Queige. [Here](https://osm.org/go/0CGCPrkVC?m=):

We were told by the townhall secretary that if this parking was full, we could use another one nearby: here is the location of the alternative parking: [here](https://osm.org/go/0CGCPowi_?m=).

We were ready to start our trek, but we realized that my friend had forgotten to bring a sandwich for our first day. We looked for a shop where we could buy some food, but we had no luck. All the shops were closed. We decided to start our trek anyway, my friend will eat some of the food he took for our seven days of hike.

Our trek began with a challenging climb that lasted for 4 hours. We had to walk on steep paths. We enjoyed the beautiful scenery of the mountains and the forests. We took a break at the “Refuge de Varzéron”, a wooden hut where hikers can rest and sleep.

At the refuge, we found a water fountain that was carved in the shape of a face and had a wooden basin. The basin was empty, and the fountain seemed dry. However, when we pulled down the pipe that came out of the mouth of the face, we managed to get a thin stream of water. We were glad that we still had some water left from Queige.

We stopped for a break behind the restaurant “Bergerie La Palette”. There was a shelter with a treasure hunt game for children in which you had to find a code to open a treasure chest.

After some landscape contemplation...

We arrived at the “Refuge du Lachat”, where hikers can stay overnight. We asked the owner if he had a place where we could pitch our tent. He recommended us a spot within 5min of walking from the refuge:

We found the spot and set up our tent. We were happy to have a place to sleep for the night. We watched the moon rise over the mountains and admired its light. We had a peaceful and pleasant night.
