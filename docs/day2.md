# Day 2 : from Refuge du Lachat to Croix de Pierre

We started by crossing a wooden bridge over the Nant Rouge stream:

Then we faced a long and steep climb to reach the top of the Chard du Beurre ski lift, where we were rewarded with a breathtaking view of the Mont Blanc.

As we continued our hike, we encountered some friendly cows that greeted us with their bell concert.

We stopped for lunch near an artificial lake that offered another stunning view of Mont Blanc.

After the break, we resumed our journey and reached the white cross on top of Mont Clocher, a landmark that can be seen from far away.

We then descended to the Refuge de la Croix de Pierre, where we enjoyed a cold drink and chatted with the keepers.

The keepers advised us to camp near the Croix de Pierre, but we decided to go a little further and found a perfect spot with a view of Mont Blanc and Lac de la Girotte.

We had a bad surprise at the end of the day when we realized that my friend's backpack was torn apart. A huge hole had opened from the top to the bottom of his backpack, exposing his belongings. We hoped that it would hold up until the end of the trek and crossed our fingers.
